Game Description :
Stone Paper Scissors, also known as Rock Paper Scissors, is a classic hand game played by two participants as a method of decision-making or simple entertainment. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three possible gestures—stone (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (two fingers extended). The outcome is determined by a set of simple rules: stone crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers stone. If both players choose the same gesture, the round is a tie. Despite its simplicity and randomness, the game can involve elements of strategy and psychology as players try to anticipate their opponent’s choices. It is often used to resolve disputes or make quick decisions in a fun and spontaneous way.
